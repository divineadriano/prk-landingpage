In the scenario that a customer is uploading a passport copy, the file is sharded (a process to break up KYC data) and each piece is encrypted and stored into multiple and distributed nodes. 
        <br/><br/>To re-assemble and grant access to onboarding teams, the customer uses a private key (similar to a password). The beauty of ProximaX KYC is that when one node becomes unavailable, the next nearest available node will instantaneously take its place, thus ensuring zero-downtime. 
        <br/><br/>Privacy is maintained through pseudonymisation by using a combination of a public key (concealing the individualâ€™s identity) and a cryptographically unique hash for the KYC file (akin to fingerprint).
        <br/><br/>The blockchain at the core is used as a secure and incorruptible index to locate and manage KYC data. A distributed file management system and a distributed database are used to store the KYC data.
